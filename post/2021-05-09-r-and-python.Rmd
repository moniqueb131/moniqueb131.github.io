Here's just some code I took from Worksheet 21:

```{R}
library(reticulate)
py_config()
py_install("pandas")
py_install("matplotlib")
matplotlib <- import("matplotlib")
matplotlib$use("Agg", force = TRUE)

```


```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas

x=np.random.normal(0,1,50)
y=np.random.normal(0,1,50)

plt.scatter(x,y)
```

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(py$x,py$y))
```

Here's an actual conversation between Python and R I devised (I'm not very good with graphs):

```{python}
a = "Greetings R, how are you?"
b = "I am fine this lovely day! Say, where are you off to?"
c = "Oh dear! Monique, you say? How strange, I am also on my way to meet with her as well! And she asked ME to help her with her project..."
d = "How rude! I'll have you know, Monique said I was a vital part for her project! What do you bring to the table?"
e = "Backbone you say? Well don't be fooled, you are just TEMPORARY! One day, Monique shall replace you with more functional and sophisticated code, such as I. It's probably why she invited us both!"
```

```{R}
a <-"Hello Python, I'm doing swell. And you?"
b <-"Well you see, a student by the name of Monique has enlisted me to help her with her project!"
c <- "Perposterous! Surely you must be mistaken, for it is I who will be helping Monique. There's no need for you."
d <- "HA! Don't make me laugh; vital? I daresay you need not come becasue you are but a speck amongst her code. In contrast, I am the very back bone of her project!"
e <- "DON'T be ridiculous! Monque, replace me?? Absurd! We'll have to hear what she has to say!"
```

```{python}
a
r.a
b
r.b
c
r.c
d
r.d
e
r.e
```

NGL, as long as I finish this project fine, I don't really care haha
